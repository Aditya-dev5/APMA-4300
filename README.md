### Abstract ###
&nbsp; The mathematical model of the carbon cycle proposed by Eriksson and Welander concerns the dynamic interactions between various carbon reservoirs in the Earth's system, such as the atmosphere, ocean, and biosphere. The model aims to quantify the exchange processes and feedback mechanisms that govern the flow of carbon, providing insights into the possibility of self-sustained oscillations and their implications for long-term environmental changes. Reproducing this model is crucial to validate its assumptions, propositions and results under contemporary computational frameworks. This project aimed to faithfully reproduce the results presented in the original study, motivated by a personal interest in mathematical modeling and its applications to diverse fields, including tackling pressing global challenges such as climate change. This interest was sparked by reading Steve Strogatz's book on Nonlinear Dynamics, which inspired my curiosity about the nonlinear nature of the world around us. This curiosity led me to explore the history of Chaos Theory, where I encountered Lorenz, the Butterfly Effect, and resources on climate modeling. I chose this topic because reproducing the carbon-cycle model involved investigating key concepts such as stability and oscillations, which are critical for solving scientific problems in a real-world context. Additionally, it provided an opportunity to apply computational tools to an impactful and meaningful topic directly related to the environment and climate change.\
&nbsp; The reproduction involved implementing the model equations using Python-based ODE solvers to simulate system dynamics. Parameter values and initial conditions were extracted from the original study, with additional analyses conducted to test stability of the model using eigenvalues of its linearised version. The results closely aligned with the findings of Eriksson and Welander, confirming the predicted cyclic behavior under certain parameter regimes. The key takeaway from this project was the accomplishment of having reproduced a research paper. I learned how to formally investigate the propositions presented in a technical document and conduct additional analyses to test their validity. This was particularly relevant in the context of analyzing the stability of fixed points, where visualizing the trajectories of the nonlinear system for various initial conditions aligned with the inferences drawn from the eigenvalues of the linearized system. Furthermore this exercise provided me practical experience with ODE solving, root-finding and stability analysis methods, enhancing my understanding of these computational techniques and how they apply to dynamical systems.
